In this project I’ve described the little information about computer, devices and computer-uses.
I’ve used four different pages that are designed with the help of CSS and BOOTSTRAP.
On a personal page, I’ve described my motivation, and applied the media query on that page.
I've used the frame which loads the different pages with the help of script.
Whenever, user clicks the button the src changes in terms of page url.
